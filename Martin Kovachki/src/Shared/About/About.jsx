            Back in 2022 I decided to sing up for SoftUni. This was the moment my coding jorney began. 
            Now, 2 years later I am looking for my first job with hopes for learning more and developing
            in the programing field.
            I know that I am only 17 but I think that in coding experience is the most importatnt plus working 
            in a team, and the only way to get that is to get a job.

      </div>
    </>
  );
}
